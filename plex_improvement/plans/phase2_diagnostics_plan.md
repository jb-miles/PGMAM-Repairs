# Phase 2 Diagnostics Plan

Goal: analyze Phase 1 aggregated logs, research root causes, validate against code, and produce a diagnostic report with prioritized fixes.

## Plan Steps

1) Create Phase 2 diagnostics plan file
- Purpose: satisfy AGENTS.md requirement to plan and track progress in markdown
- Output if correct: this plan document exists and tracks progress
- Status: in progress

2) Analyze aggregated logs
- Purpose: identify major error patterns, counts, and affected agents
- Output if correct: error pattern list with counts and impacted agents
- Status: pending

3) Inspect agent code
- Purpose: validate error locations and expected behavior against actual code
- Output if correct: code references and paths for each error type
- Status: pending

4) Research root causes (multi-source)
- Purpose: confirm likely causes using web sources and documentation
- Output if correct: citations backing each root cause and proposed fix
- Status: pending

5) Write diagnostic report
- Purpose: produce actionable, prioritized recommendations with expected results
- Output if correct: diagnostic_report_iteration_1.md in reports directory
- Status: pending
